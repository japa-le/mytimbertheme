								<div class="textcl">
									<p>I started my professional career in the automotive industry, working as a mechanic. While I enjoyed the work, I found myself more addicted to the world of information technology. Then i found a job as a supplier of ICT equipment where i could learn the work of an IT service engineer and in this job it has been confirmed that IT was the right career field for me.<br><br>

										I decided to pursue a degree in business information technology at the ZHAW, a program that was very future-oriented and only required a technical maturity to attend. I started the technical maturity program with 26 and then started at the ZHAW right after. It was a challenging program, but with hard work and dedication, I was able to complete the program and earn my degree at the age of 32.</p>

									<p>In this section I would like to explain the study program in more detail, because based on my experiences I am always confronted with the fact that people outside of Switzerland underestimate my skills.<br><br>
										This study program was made to eliminate the shortage of skilled workers in the trained application area. It is a fully recognized education to get the best jobs in Switzerland. Even as a career changer, one is qualified for a job as a project manager, business analyst, product owner or, with the skills I have acquired in my previous job, as a developer (what I would prefer to work in).<br><br>
										In the Screenshot on the left hand side you will find what Chatgpt says about this program.</p>

									<p>After I finished my university, I felt ready for a new challenge. I had always wanted to explore new places and improve my English language skills, so I decided to move to Bangkok. It was a big step, but I was excited to see what opportunities awaited me.
																				
										I found a job at a digital marketing agency. While the job was challenging and rewarding in many ways, I ultimately realized that it wasn't the right fit for me. I made the difficult decision to resign and start searching for a new opportunity.<br><br>

										Currently I study Thai language as I believe that learning the local language is important to fully immerse oneself in a new culture.
																				
										Now, as I continue my job search, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I know that finding the right job can take time and patience, but I am confident that I will find a position that is a good fit for my skills and interests.</p>
